# Malware Classification

In this notebook I have demonstrated how to use machine learning to classify malwares in designated 9 classes.
The dataset is taken from  Microsoft Malware Detection Challange hosted on kaggle.

Data Type: text stored in.ASM & .bytes files (10.8k each)

Key Feature Engineering methods used: 
1. uni grams, bi-grams for op codes in ASM files
2. top k features selection
3. Converting data to image and reading first 800 pixels as features

Evaluation metric - Multiclass logloss
Best result achieved - logloss = 0.00695
